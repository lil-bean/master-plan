<h3> as maria violette tranchot said, </h3>
<p> “to understand the future, we study the past. [...] we know the past best by the future it dreams.” </p>
<p> tranchot theorized that the method of utopia involves measuring the distance between a given society’s reality and its dreams. once you identify the dream, you can start mapping out how to get there. </p>
<br>
<h3> de // stabilize is a collective </h3>
<p> formed using this utopian method. though a specific dream state is not outlined, the utopia imagined is one of constant self-recognition, progress, and growth. there is no single vision of perfection; instead, utopia lies in the act of striving. </p>
<p> in this utopian effort, the problem identified is this: constructs of gender and sexuality in the united states are too institutionalized, naturalized, and embedded in structures of daily life. we take categories of gender and sexuality for granted because they help construct our realities. (see the manifesto for more explanation on what that means.) with de // stabilize, i want to encourage people to question these categories and their meanings. the goal is to literally destabilize the things we may view as fixed, which i believe is a crucial step in enacting change of any kind. destabilization is necessary in revealing points of agency from which activism can develop. 
</p>     
<p> the idea with de // stabilize is that incremental change occurs on multiple levels, as much as each member chooses. participating in discussion on the online platform is only one aspect of the this utopian method; the idea is that members will then approach their daily lives with this perspective, incorporating what they’re learning into what they already do. 
</p>
<p> academic researchers might study the historical construction of gender and sexuality in the u.s. alongside other social constructs/institutions, creating knowledge in the realm of academia. they might study intersectional forms of marginalization in order to understand how gender and sexuality interact with other social institutions. they might look at anything from expressions of gender in online dating profiles to constructions of biphobia in lgbtqia+ communities to meanings of masculinity and how they differ between racial and/or ethnic groups in america. </p>
<p> those who work in fields or professions heavily dominated by men might make efforts to be more attuned to bigoted behaviors and call out problematic behavior in coworkers. </p>
<p> individuals who work for the government/political officials might push for change on smaller and larger scales, such as in how benefits are distributed, how gender, sex, and sexuality are defined in regulation and legislation, and how different policies affect americans and how they interact with public institutions. </p>
<p> artists of all types might create works meant to inspire critical thought among their audience(s), such as through writing children’s stories with characters who don’t conform to gender expectations, creating simulation games with where players explore ideas out of their realm of personal experience, or photographing forms of body positivity that challenge gendered definitions of beauty and physical attractiveness. </p>
<p> members, wherever they are, may approach everyday interactions and encourage others to destabilize their thought processes and beliefs. this is a utopia that aims to infiltrate existing life through online networking, through creating a space for destabilization to begin. where it goes depends on where each member takes it.
