    <h3> WHAT IS DE // STABILIZE? </h3>
    <p> de // stabilize is a collective aimed at destabilizing constructs of gender and sexuality in the U.S. it primarily exists as a digital space for discussion and sharing of experiences, although the intention is for individuals to apply what they learn to their daily lives. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> WHO IS DE // STABILIZE? </h3>
    <p> the collective is comprised of whomever wants to be a part of it. there are, of course, several positions required for the platform itself to exist; individuals who are well-versed in web design and computer science are crucial to actually creating the website, and moderators are needed to ensure the safety and well-being of members as they interact. members themselves are also crucial because the whole point is for people to talk about it. we can’t do that unless we have different voices in the mix. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> WHO CAN JOIN? </h3>
    <p> anyone can join … but that doesn’t mean that anyone can just do whatever they want without consequence. being part of the collective means the following: </p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;>  ❖ you are willing to critique your own privilege and learn when it’s time to shut up </p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ you are willing to question things you’ve been taught and taken for granted </p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ you are willing to explore the construction behind ideas, facts, beliefs, etc. </p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ you are willing to reflect on your own behavior and listen to others’ concerns </p>
    <p> anonymity is cool because it can be protective and liberating. anonymity is uncool because it can make people feel like they aren’t accountable for their actions. you’re not required to publicly list any identifying information, but for the sake of accountability, some personal information is needed in order to join (just basic stuff like your name and email address). </p>
    <p> this first go-around will only be in english/aimed at a U.S. audience, but it’s just a starting point for further expansion. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> WHY ONLINE? </h3>
    <p> this space is intended to be as accessible as possible. by creating a platform online, participation is less limited by physical proximity; instead of needing to go to a physical location, participation requires only an internet connection and a device that can utilize that connection. an online network has greater potential to reach people who normally may not have access to this community and these conversations.  </p>
    <p> that’s not to say that it’s completely accessible, however; you need to be familiar with the internet and how to navigate it, you need to be literate, you need to have internet access and a device, you need to have time to use social media, you need to be able to use the english language, etc. etc. etc. the diversity of experience we hope to cultivate is inevitably accompanied by existing inequalities and differing levels of knowledge. we acknowledge that and hope to mediate conflict with respect to everyone’s experiences. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONS OF THIS PLATFORM? </h3>
    <p> the functions of this platform are to</p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ connect people over distance + time</p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ encourage discussion, collaboration, learning, action <p/>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ initiate change on all levels of life </p>
    <p> on the platform, users primarily interact via making posts and discussing them. the home page depicts some mock posts, and if you click on the first one, a mockup of the discussion section will appear to the right. the squares in this discussion mockup represent different users, and the dark blue lines represent people’s comments. the gray lines that branch out from each square represent levels of commenting; following a line allows a user to see the linear progression of a conversation. </p>
    <p> the “about” page contains the manifesto of de // stabilize. </p>
    <p> the “join” page contains two mock buttons inviting people to either sign in or join the collective. </p>
    <p> there is no direct/private messaging platform because we want to encourage people to have communal discussions as opposed to highly individualized ones. users who want to privately communicate always have the option to do so on another platform that has a messaging feature. </p>
    <p> there is also no option to “react” to posts other than commenting. you can’t “like” or “heart” anything. while these actions are communicative and central to other platforms, they can also be vague and misinterpreted. we want to encourage people to communicate clearly using words. </p>
    <p> there are no public profiles or individual blogs for people to maintain on de // stabilize because the focus of the platform is really to encourage interaction and contribution to larger wholes. public profiles often contain an archive of someone’s participation, and we want to avoid that (although that information will be accessible privately to users themselves). </p>
    <p> membership is required to participate, but posts and discussions are public. the purpose of this is to allow everyone to see the content of this website while maintaining accountability (if you have to be a member in order to participate, you can be held responsible for things you say and do). </p>
    <p> guidelines for choosing content moderators have not yet been determined, but this process is important to maintaining a constructive but still safe space. guidelines will be transparent and available for all users to examine. these moderators will be crucial in mediating conflict when it arises.  </p>
    <br>
    <h3> WHY A NEW PLATFORM? </h3>
    <p> many aspects of this platform are inspired by existing social media platforms such as facebook, twitter, tumblr, and reddit. this kind of collective could exist on an existing platform. however, in doing so, you are subject to the terms and conditions of that platform. you have to participate in that company’s data collection and advertising tactics. the purpose of de // stabilize is not to collect personal information for profit or be subject to those terms, and the new platform reflects that. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> HOW WILL THIS COLLECTIVE BE IMPLEMENTED? </h3>
    <p> creating this collective would require a team of people who are passionate about the project and are able to incorporate a wide variety of experiences. we want diverse voices from people of all racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, genders, sexual orientations, socioeconomic classes, ability statuses, ages, and experiences. we would also need web designers and computer scientists to help build the actual platform. someone with legal expertise would also be helpful in making sure that the platform is safe. feedback from people of any and all professions could aid in formulating this platform. </p>
    <p> after the platform is created and guidelines are established, the next step is to find people who want to join the collective. </p>
    <br> 
    <h3> BROADSIDES AND DISSEMINATION </h3>
    <p> these broadsides are made up of the following components:</p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ a post found online, serving as an example of something that could be a topic of discussion </p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ a brief description of what could be problematic about the post</p>
    <p style=margin-left:20px;> ❖ a link to the de // stabilize platform, titled "let's talk about it." </p>
    <p> these broadsides are intended point out everyday things and suggest that we dig deeper in trying to understand and talk about them them. ideally, the people who see these broadsides and have something to say will click on the link to check out and maybe join de // stabilize.</p>
    <p> the posts for these broadsides were chosen online because they are aimed at an online audience. broadsides distributed as physical posters or handouts could have similar content but could also be designed for different settings and social situations. the possible broadsides are endless, as there are endless things to talk about, and those depicted here are only a few examples. </p>
    <p> these broadsides can be posted on any number of existing social media platforms and networks, utilizing the connections that people have already cultivated. the format is easily adaptable to platforms such as facebook, instagram, twitter, reddit, and tumblr. </p>
    <p> below are 4 examples of broadsides that could be posted.</p>
